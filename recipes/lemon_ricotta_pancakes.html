  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup cold water or milk</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon melted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon self-rising flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar,
      egg, and
      vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup
      plus 2
      tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
    <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter
      onto
      skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look
      dry (2
      to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
