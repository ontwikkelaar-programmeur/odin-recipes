  <img src="img/Turkey_sandwich.jpg" alt="Turkey sandwich served">
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Not your average hot turkey sandwich, the Hot Brown was invented at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky to
    absorb the bourbon that guests would enjoy well into the night.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>For the turkey (4 portions)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds boneless turkey breast with skin on</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
    <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For 4 Hot Browns</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 slices white bread, toasted</li>
    <li>12 slices tomato</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons chopped Italian parsley, or to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fº (175 degrees Cº)</li>
    <li>Season the skinless side of the turkey breast with 1/2 of the kosher salt and herbes de Provence. Season the
      skin side with the remaining kosher salt. Place turkey skin-side up into an oiled baking dish.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the turkey registers 148 degrees Fº
      (64 degrees Cº), 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place bacon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Remove turkey from the oven and let cool.</li>
    <li>Bake bacon in the hot oven until about halfway cooked, 10 to 15 minutes</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Stir in flour until combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, until roux
      smells like cooked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream all at once. Cook until Mornay sauce is thickened
      and starting to boil, about 5 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Season Mornay sauce with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese until
      combined. Add nutmeg and stir briefly.</li>
    <li>Cut turkey into thick slices. Pull off the skin</li>
    <li>Stack 2 bread slices on top of each other and trim off the crusts. Cut 1 slice into 2 triangles. Place bread in
      a small baking dish set on top of a sheet pan. Top bread with 3 slices of turkey. Place 3 tomato slices in
      between. Ladle 1/4 of the Mornay sauce all over and cover with 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese. Sprinkle with
      paprika; lay the partially cooked bacon across the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more servings.
    </li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler</li>
    <li>Bake under the broiler until bacon is crispy and the tops are well browned, about 5 minutes. Place on
      napkin-lined plates and sprinkle parsley over each dish.</li>
  </ol>
